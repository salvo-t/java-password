in this random password generator. I added alerts saying how long the password should be 
uppercase/lowercase/symbols(special characters). made it so you couldnt use letters in the first prompt
All the lists are made with IF statments and are pushed to a "master" list(listContainer) then pushed to the FOR statement were it is looped ending with the final password on the website. Added a default if none is selected. Made the limit from 8-128 characters. Everything works as intended and the final password shows up on the website.
